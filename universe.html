                    <h1><strong>ðŸš€ Universe Language ðŸŒŒ</strong></h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Universe Language</strong> is a dynamically evolving, high-level programming language designed with love in the internal cooking room of WebSolvus engineers.</li>
                        <li>Currently under development and testing, the first release will be available very soon for the public.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Universe Language</strong> aims to make programming more accessible by:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simplifying syntax âœ¨</li>
                            <li>Providing concepts of object-oriented programming in a newer and easier-to-use format ðŸ¤–</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Additionally, it targets mathematical purposes and will continue to evolve with new features based on evolving needs and requirements ðŸ“ˆ.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Universe Language</strong> is a high-level language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.</li>
                        <li>It uses the file extension <strong>.univ</strong>, but during the testing phase, we are using <strong>.el</strong> (derived from a project called Easier Language).</li>
                        <li>The history of the <strong>Universe Language</strong> dates back to 2018 when the idea was conceived. The goal was to create a programming language that could serve both developers and non-developers, striking a balance between complexity and feasibility of syntax and concepts.</li>
                        <li>In 2019, the development of the <strong>Universe Language</strong> officially began, incorporating the approach of mathematical purposes into its design.</li>
                        <li>Between 2020 and 2022, the development faced a temporary halt as the team worked on other projects.</li>
                        <li>The team returned to the development of the <strong>Universe Language</strong> in the latter months of 2023 to release it for the public.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Universe Language</strong> is proudly made in Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦, marking it as the first Moroccan programming language.</li>
